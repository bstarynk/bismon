# Overview and philosophy #

`bismon` (this is a *temporary* name) is a **persistent monitor** which (in the future) would interact with the [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler thru plugins.
It is (or will become) somehow a successor to my old [GCC MELT](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/gcc-melt/) project; the medium-term goal is also [static program source code analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) with the help of [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/).

My ([Basile Starynkevitch](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/), employed
at [CEA, LIST](http://www-list.cea.fr/) in France) work on `bismon` is
partly funded (from start of 2018 to end of 2020) by the European
Union, Horizon H2020 programme, [CHARIOT](http://chariotproject.eu/)
project, under Grant Agreement No 780075. Within CHARIOT I will focus
on analysis of some kind of
[IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) software coded
in C or C++ and (cross-) compiled by [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) on
some Linux desktop.

Currently (mid-2018) `bismon` still in **pre alpha**-stage, and it is *free software* under [GPLv3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license. It is intended for a Linux x86-64 desktop developer's workstation (won't work on Windows or MacOSX or Android).

## Approach ##

*Develop some kind of* high-level (more expressive, more declarative)
[**domain-specific
language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) to
facilitate [static program source code
analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) above
[GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) and *generate* [GCC plugins](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Plugins.html) for it, so same motivations as [GCC
MELT](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/gcc-melt/) (and more broadly
related -in motivations- to [Coccinnelle](http://coccinelle.lip6.fr),
[Frama-C](http://frama-c.com), [Rascal](https://www.rascal-mpl.org/),
[CrossMiner](https://www.crossminer.org/), [Clang
analyser](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/), [Clasp](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp) etc...).


Important features and goals of that domain-specific language and its implementation include:

* [orthogonal persistence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_%28computer_science%29);
this is a *major* feature (useful for *whole program* static source code
analysis of an analyzed program made of *several* translation units, each compiled independently)
which was not realistically addable to [GCC
MELT](http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/gcc-melt/) so requires a
complete redesign. The `bismon` process is expected to be relatively
long-lived -server like- and retains most of its data from one run to
the next (in `store*.bmon` textual files). In the future the `bismon`
process will communicate with `gcc` or `g++` (cross-)compilation
processes (using some [GCC
plugin](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Plugins.html), to be
generated by `bismon` itself)

* [dynamic typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC) like in Python, Scheme, Ruby, JavaScript, ... (and somehow MELT).

*
  [multi-threaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29)
  but without any
  [GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock). A
  small thread pool of worker threads is repeatedly and concurrently
  fetching tasklets from a global agenda. Each tasklet runs quickly
  (milliseconds) in some worker thread and can update that agenda
  (e.g. by adding itself to be continued).

* [reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29)

* [homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity)

* precisely [garbage collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29)

* [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming), with good pattern matching and rules formalisms

* [bootstrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28compilers%29),
  and [compiled to C](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/257873/40065),
  perhaps some parts using [GCCJIT](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/).

* so [metaprogrammed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)

* generating GCC plugins (in C++) which would interact with `bismon` by some RPC mechanism

Notice that the syntax and semantics (still undocumented) of `bismon` is *work-in-progress* and subject to change incompatibly.

# build instructions #

On Linux/x86-64 (e.g. Debian/Unstable or recent Ubuntu) only (won't work on 32 bits machines!):

## prerequisites ##


See also the [dependencies](dependencies/README-dependencies) subdirectory.

* recent [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) (so [GCC
7](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/) or [GCC 8](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/) ...), with C and C++ and JIT
support and plugins enabled (check with `gcc -v`; if your system `gcc`
and `g++` lack support for plugins and
[libgccjit](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/), you should build and
[install](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) a recent GCC release from its
source code, and configure it to provide them.).

Most of `bismon` is in C99 (including an increasing amount of
generated code), but some few code is in C++14.

* [GTK](http://gtk.org/) 3.22 or better. This is a temporary
  dependency (to be deprecated), we hope to have some web interface
  (above [libonion](http://www.coralbits.com/libonion) probably) soon.
  
* [libonion](http://www.coralbits.com/libonion) is needed for the web interface.

* [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 4 or better

* [libbacktrace](https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace) - it is sometimes part of your system *GCC*, but you'll better install it separately (e.g. in your `/usr/local/` prefix)

* [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is required for some documentation, such as this `README.md`

* GNU [indent](https://www.gnu.org/software/indent/) (2.2.x at last) and [astyle](https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/)  (3.1 at least) are useful for `make indent`. `indent` is now **required** for generated modules.

* [LaTeX](https://latex.org/) -probably as
  [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) suite or
  [luatex](http://luatex.org/)- and related utilities (`pdflatex`,
  `makeidx`, `bibtex` ...) with [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and
  [hevea](http://hevea.inria.fr/) are needed for documentation.

### relevant Debian/Ubuntu build-dependency packages ###

On Debian/Unstable or Ubuntu, `apt-get install build-essential make gcc-7 g++-7 gcc-7-plugin-dev libgccjit-7-dev` for the building infrastructure. Replace 7 by 8 when using GCC 8.

`apt-get install libgtk-3-dev` for GTK 3. This may pull a lot of dependencies.

The `libbacktrace` is not independently packaged in Debian. I recommend building and installing
it from its source code, or else (not recommended, :unamused: but doable) edit the `Makefile` to uses your system GCC compiler's one.

The `libonion` is not independently packaged in Debian.

`apt-get install markdown indent astyle` and `apt-get install texlive texlive-full hevea` 

The `dependencies/` subdirectory is for `git submodule`-s related to `libbacktrace` and `libonion`

## building ##

Clone this `git` repository as usual, and build then use `bismon`
inside the obtained source tree.

Look into the `Makefile`, and edit it if needed; perhaps update the
`PREPROFLAGS=` and `LIBES=` lines, e.g. to use your system's GCC
`libbacktrace`, by adding `$(shell gcc-7 -print-file-name=include)`
into the `PREPROFLAGS=` line, and `$(shell gcc-7
-print-file-name=libbacktrace.a)` to the `LIBES=` line. Of course
replace the 7 by 8 if appropriate. Maybe you need to explicitly set
`GCC=` and `GXX=` to your specific GCC *C* and *C++* compilers.

Run `make` or `make -j3`

The persistency mechanism is tested by `make redump`

The `./bismongtk` program accepts a `--help` and `--version`.
It has a crude graphic user interface (perhaps to be replaced later by a Web one).

The `./bismonion` program accepts a `--help` and `--version`. It has a
Web interface (above `libonion`)

## using `bismon` ##

It is **not really usable yet** except by me (Basile) in april 2018 (no
static source code analysis yet, no generation of GCC plugins yet). If
you want to see something, run `./bismon` then type `the_system` in the command window
labelled *new-bismon*, then both *Ctrl* and *Return* keys pressed
together.

It is recommended to run `make clean` once in a while (e.g. daily or
weekly). When generating files, `bismon` makes a backup of their
previous version.

Ask me (Basile Starynkevitch,
[`basile@starynkevitch.net`](mailto:basile@starynkevitch.net) or
[`basile.starynkevitch@cea.fr`](mailto:basile.starynkevitch@cea.fr)...)
for details.
