\subsection{Building \texttt{bismon} from its source code}
\label{subsec:building-bismon}

We focus here on how to build \texttt{bismon} from its source code on
\href{http://debian.org/}{Debian}-like distributions running on
x86-64 computers, such as
\href{https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/}{Debian Buster 10.6}, or
\href{https://ubuntu.com/}{Ubuntu 20.04}, or
\href{https://linuxmint.com/}{Linux Mint 20}. Familiarity with the
command line is required\footnote{For example, the reader is expected
  of being able to build \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{GNU
    make} or \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/}{GNU bash} from
  their source code.}, with \texttt{root} access (e.g. using
\texttt{sudo}).
