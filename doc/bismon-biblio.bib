                  semantic-aware version of the World Wide Web. The
                  availability of large-scale high quality domain
                  ontologies depends on effective and usable
                  methodologies aimed at supporting the crucial
                  process of ontology building. Ontology building
                  exhibits a structural and logical complexity that is
                  comparable to the production of software
                  artefacts. This paper proposes an ontology building
                  methodology that capitalizes the large experience
                  drawn from a widely used standard in software
                  engineering: the Unified Software Development
                  Process or Unified Process (UP). In particular, we
                  propose UP for ONtology (UPON) building, a
                  methodology for ontology building derived from the
                  UP. UPON is presented with the support of a
                  practical example in the eBusiness domain. A
                  comparative evaluation with other methodologies and
                  the results of its adoption in the context of the

  abstract =	 {Abstract Software development firms have begun
                  adopting the practice of global software development
                  (GSD). The main reason for the shift toward
                  globalization is the various benefits received by
                  software development firms. However, there are
                  several issues faced by GSD organizations,
                  particularly those associated with software process
                  improvement (SPI). It has been noticed that a formal
                  process improvement approach could assist in
                  successfully executing development activities in
                  GSD. The core objective of this research work is to
                  develop a global software engineering process
                  improvement model (GSEPIM) to assess and improve
                  software process activities in a GSD
                  environment. The proposed model will be developed
                  based on existing models in other domains, an
                  empirical study conducted with GSD practitioners,
                  and an understanding of critical success factors and
                  challenges of SPI. In this study, the first step in
                  the development of GSEPIM is completed by
                  identifying the challenges of SPI in GSD and
                  presenting a solution in the form of a robust
                  framework.},

                  source software development, which involves
                  developers at many different locations and
                  organizations sharing code to develop and refine
                  programs.  To an economist, the behavior of
                  individual programmers and commercial companies
                  engaged in open source projects is initially
                  startling. This paper makes a preliminary
                  exploration of the economics of open source
                  software. We highlight the extent to which labor
                  economics, especially the literature on career
                  concerns,' can explain many of these projects'
                  features.  Aspects of the future of open source
                  development process, however, remain somewhat
                  difficult to predict with off-the-shelf' economic
                  models.},

                  usage in language definition by the introduction of
                  a compiler written in the same language it
                  compiles. This process is important to understand
                  and modify the definition of a given language using
                  the same language, taking benefit of the
                  abstractions and expression power it provides. A
                  bootstrap, then, supports the evolution of a
                  language. However, the infrastructure of reflective
                  systems like Smalltalk includes, in addition to a
                  compiler, an environment with several
                  self-references. A reflective system bootstrap
                  should consider all its infrastructural
                  components. In this paper, we propose a definition
                  of bootstrap for object-oriented reflective systems,
                  we describe the architecture and components it
                  should contain and we analyze the challenges it has
                  to overcome. Finally, we present a reference
                  bootstrap process for a reflective system and
                  Hazelnut, its implementation for bootstrapping the
                  Pharo Smalltalk-inspired system."

                  systems are emerging and evolving fast in order to
                  systematically and spontaneously tackle the growing
                  varieties and vagaries of data structures, schemas,
                  sizes, speeds, and scopes. That is, all kinds of
                  data have to be carefully and consciously collected,
                  cleansed, and crunched in order to squeeze out
                  actionable and timely insights out of exponentially
                  exploding data heaps. Data is turning out be a
                  strategic asset for any growing and glowing
                  organization across the world in order to devise
                  perfect and precise strategies and roll out correct
                  activities in time with all the clarity, continuity,
                  and confidence. The noteworthy point here is that
                  you cannot throw out any data (internal as well as
                  external) as data can potentially emit viable and
                  venerable information and insights when subjected to
                  decisive and deeper investigations. Not only for
                  data transformation, ingestion, mining, processing,
                  and analytics but also for effective data
                  engineering, management, governance, representation,
                  exchange, persistence, and science, we need
                  efficient technologies, tools, and tips. As we are
                  heading toward the dreamt knowledge era, the role
                  and responsibility of new-generation database
                  systems are bound to escalate in the days
                  ahead. This chapter is primarily prepared to tell
                  all about the various NoSQL and NewSQL databases and
                  how they come handy in augmenting, accelerating, and
                  automating the highly complicated phenomenon of
                  next-generation data analytics."
