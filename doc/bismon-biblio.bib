The main reason for the shift toward globalization is the various benefits received by software development firms. However, there are several issues faced by GSD organizations, particularly those associated with software process improvement (SPI). It has been noticed that a formal process improvement approach could assist in successfully executing development activities in GSD. The core objective of this research work is to develop a global software engineering process improvement model (GSEPIM) to assess and improve software process activities in a GSD environment. The proposed model will be developed based on existing models in other domains, an empirical study conducted with GSD practitioners, and an understanding of critical success factors and challenges of SPI. In this study, the first step in the development of GSEPIM is completed by identifying the challenges of SPI in GSD and presenting a solution in the form of a robust framework.},

                  organizations sharing code to develop and refine
                  programs.  To an economist, the behavior of
                  individual programmers and commercial companies

                  startling. This paper makes a preliminary
                  exploration of the economics of open source
                  software. We highlight the extent to which labor
                  economics, especially the literature on career
                  concerns,' can explain many of these projects'
                  features.  Aspects of the future of open source

                  difficult to predict with off-the-shelf' economic

This process is important to understand and modify the definition of a given language using the same language, taking benefit of the abstractions and expression power it provides. A bootstrap, then, supports the evolution of a language. However, the infrastructure of reflective systems like Smalltalk includes, in addition to a compiler, an environment with several self-references. A reflective system bootstrap should consider all its infrastructural components. In this paper, we propose a definition of bootstrap for object-oriented reflective systems, we describe the architecture and components it should contain and we analyze the challenges it has to overcome. Finally, we present a reference bootstrap process for a reflective system and Hazelnut, its implementation for bootstrapping the Pharo Smalltalk-inspired system."

                  systems are emerging and evolving fast in order to
                  systematically and spontaneously tackle the growing
                  varieties and vagaries of data structures, schemas,
                  sizes, speeds, and scopes. That is, all kinds of
                  data have to be carefully and consciously collected,
                  cleansed, and crunched in order to squeeze out
                  actionable and timely insights out of exponentially
                  exploding data heaps. Data is turning out be a
                  strategic asset for any growing and glowing
                  organization across the world in order to devise
                  perfect and precise strategies and roll out correct
                  activities in time with all the clarity, continuity,
                  and confidence. The noteworthy point here is that
                  you cannot throw out any data (internal as well as
                  external) as data can potentially emit viable and
                  venerable information and insights when subjected to
                  decisive and deeper investigations. Not only for
                  data transformation, ingestion, mining, processing,
                  and analytics but also for effective data
                  engineering, management, governance, representation,
                  exchange, persistence, and science, we need
                  efficient technologies, tools, and tips. As we are
                  heading toward the dreamt knowledge era, the role
                  and responsibility of new-generation database
                  systems are bound to escalate in the days
                  ahead. This chapter is primarily prepared to tell
                  all about the various NoSQL and NewSQL databases and
                  how they come handy in augmenting, accelerating, and
                  automating the highly complicated phenomenon of
                  next-generation data analytics."
