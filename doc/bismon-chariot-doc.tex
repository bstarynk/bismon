This partly generated document and the \emph{Bismon} software itself
are co-developed in an agile and incremental manner, and have exactly
{\bmgitnumbercommits} \href{http://git-scm.com/}{\texttt{git}} commits
on \textit{\bmdoctimestamp}. For more, please see
\bmurl{https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/commits/} for details. These
commits are too many and too fine grained to be considered as
``versions''. Given the agile and continuous workflow, it is
unreasonable, and practically impossible, to identify any formalized
versions.

\begin{relsize}{-0.5}
This document is co-developed with the \emph{Bismon} software itself,
it was typeset using \LaTeX~on Linux and contains some \emph{generated}
documentation~\footnote{The generated parts are clearly identified as
  such, and are extracted from the \emph{Bismon} system.}, mixed with
hand-written text. During development of \texttt{bismon}, the amount
of generated documentation will grow.  The entire history of
\emph{Bismon} (both the software -including its persistent store- and
this document) is available on
\bmurl{https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/commits} and has, for this
document of commit id \texttt{\bmgitcommit} (done on \emph{\bmgitdate}) generated on
\textit{\bmdocdate}, exactly {\bmgitnumbercommits} commits (or
elementary changes). Since changes on any file in the \texttt{git}
repository can affect this document, no ``version'' is identifiable.
\end{relsize}
\bigskip

For convenience to the reader, here are the last~\footnote{Obtained by the
  \texttt{git log --name-status -3} command running in \emph{bismon}
  top source directory.} three \texttt{git commit}-s:

\begin{relsize}{-2}
  \input{generated/000-lastgitcommits.tex}

There is no notion of any identifiable ``version'' in \emph{bismon}, so
also in this D1.3~\textsuperscript{v2-} deliverable. The work is incremental and the
development is agile.

  \subsection*{Executive Summary}

  This D1.3\textsuperscript{v1} \textsc{Chariot} deliverable is
  {\color{red}{(was)}} a first \textbf{draft} -and \emph{preliminary}-
  version (at M12) of D1.3\textsuperscript{v2} scheduled at M30 on
  ``Specialized Static Analysis tools for more secure and safer IoT
  software development''.

But {\color{red}{\textbf{incremental work has begun on
      D1.3\textsuperscript{v2} in early 2019}}}, hence the
D1.3\textsuperscript{v2-} in the header.

It describes the \textsc{Chariot} vision on static source code (mostly
of C and C++ code for IoT firmware and application) analysis. It
proposes a \emph{simple} static analysis \emph{framework} leveraging
on the powerful recent \emph{GCC} [cross-]compiler. A \emph{persistent
  monitor} (tentatively named \texttt{bismon}) is being designed and
implemented as a GPLv3+ free software for Linux, using
meta-programming techniques (leveraging on experience gained in the
former GCC MELT project) to \emph{generate} GCC plugins, and able to
keep some intermediate results (of compilation or static analysis)
during the entire life of the IoT project, and giving to the IoT
developers (thru a web interface) a whole-program view of the source
code (as digested by the \emph{GCC} cross-compiler) and of its static
analysis properties. That framework is configurable and scriptable by
static analysis experts, hence permitting different IoT projects to
address various concerns, while keeping the usual IoT development
workflow (running as usual their \emph{GCC} cross-compiler on Linux,
with extra plugin-related compilation flags).  The deliverable has
been structured starting from the identification of the software and
tool users and the document expected audience as well as the vision on
specialized source code analysis towards more secure and safer IoT
software development. The report then describes its strong alignment
to adding capabilities to \emph{GCC} as well as the driving principles of the
tools. Data and their persistence character are also described
including mutable and non-mutable values/types while persistence is
considered to start by loading some previous persisted state, usually
dumping its current state before termination and loading the next
state on the next load-up. The framework for static code analysis is
also defined as part of the \emph{GCC} compilation process. The described
work is also analysed in terms of contributing to other free software
projects.

Thanks to my colleague Franck Védrine, to several members of the \textsc{Chariot} consortium who have
proofread this report, and to Niklas Rosencratz (from Sweden, outside
of the consortium) who voluntarily found mistakes in it and proposed,
in the repository on \bmurl{https://github.com/montao/bismon-docker/},
a \texttt{Dockerfile} for \emph{bismon}.

Thanks also to Jérémie Salvucci (France) and Abhishek Chakravarti
(India) for many valuable questions, suggestions, and discussions -in
numerous audioconference (or face to face) exchanges, or in private
emails-, about reflexive persistent systems in general, and more
specifically about \emph{Bismon}. Both did suggest several
improvements to this report and to the \emph{Bismon} software.

The CC-BY-SA license below for this (\textsc{Chariot}
D1.3\textsuperscript{v2}) deliverable is required to enable major parts
of this report to be later incorporated into a proper
\emph{bismon} free software documentation. For example, the Debian
Linux distribution has a policy~\footnote{See Debian documentation
  project on \bmurl{https://www.debian.org/doc/ddp} etc...} strongly
recommending a specific set of licenses (notably CC-BY-SA) for
documentation. Using other (deemed proprietary) licenses in free
software documentation is decreasing the future chances of such
documentation being later incorporated in Linux distributions.
