\section{Conclusion}

The \texttt{bismon} free software is developed in an agile and
incremental manner~\footnote{So there are no released stable versions
  of this software, but snapshots.} (required by its bootstrapping
approach), with continuous updates to
\bmurl{https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/}.

In october 2018, the persistence machinery is working and daily used
to enhance \texttt{bismon}. The agenda mechanism is working. A naive
stop-the-world mark-and-sweep precise garbage collector is
implemented. The generation of internal C code is done (by
hand-written routines, still coded in C). The web interface is worked
upon: a \texttt{libonion} based infrastructure is already handling
HTTP requests, and a GDPR-compliant login form is presented on web
browsers.
