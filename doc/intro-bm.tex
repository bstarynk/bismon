\subsection{About \textit{Bismon}}

\textit{Bismon} (a \emph{temporary name}) \footnote{\texttt{bismon} is a \textbf{temporary name}
  and could be changed, once we find a better name for it} is a free
software (GPLv3+ licensed)\footnote{The source code is unreleased but available, and continuously evolving, on \bmurl{github.com/bstarynk/bismon}} static source code whole-program analysis framework whose
initial domain will be \emph{Internet of Things} (or
\index{IoT}{IoT})\footnote{IoT is viewed as the first application
  domain of \textit{Bismon}, but it is hoped that most of
  \textit{Bismon} could be reused and later extended for other
  domains}. It is designed to work with the \textit{Gcc} compiler (see
\bmurl{gcc.gnu.org}) on a Linux workstation\footnote{Linux specific features are needed by \textit{Bismon}, which is unlikely to be buildable or run under other operating systems. My Linux distribution is \emph{Debian/Unstable}}. \textit{Bismon} is the
successor of \textit{GCC MELT} \footnote{The \textit{GCC MELT} web
  pages used to be on \texttt{gcc-melt.org} -a DNS domain relinquished
  in april 2018- and are archived on
  \bmurl{starynkevitch.net/Basile/gcc-melt}} (see \cite{Starynkevitch2007Multistage, starynkevitch-DSL2011}).

{\large \textit{Bismon} is \textbf{work in progress}}, and many things
described here are not (fully, or even partly!) implemented in 2018 or
could drastically change later. In particular, \textit{Bismon} is not
yet usable as a static source code analyser in mid-2018 (since work on
the infrastructure is not complete).

\subsection{Lessons learned from \textit{GCC MELT}}

@@ To be written

\subsection{Driving principles for  \textit{Bismon}}

\textit{Bismon} is (like \textit{GCC MELT} was) a \textbf{domain
  specific language} implementation, targetted to ease static source
code analysis (above the \textit{GCC} compiler), with the following
features:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \index{persistency}{\textbf{persistency}}, somehow
    \textit{orthogonal persistency}. It is needed in particular
    because compiling some software project (analyzed by
    \textit{Bismon}) is a long-lasting procedure involving
    \textit{several} compiling and linking processes and commands. So
    most of the data handled by \textit{Bismon} can be persisted on
    disk, and reloaded at the next run. However, some data is
    temporary by nature\footnote{e.g. data related to a web session,
      or to a web HTTP exchange, needs not to be persisted} and should
    not be persisted. Such data is called temporary or
    \index{transient}{\textbf{transient}}. But the usual approach is
    to run the \textit{Bismon} program from some initial loaded state
    and have it \index{dump}{\textbf{dump}} its memory state on disk
    before exiting (and reload that augmented state at the next run),
    and probably more often than that (e.g. twice an hour, or even
    every five minutes).

  \item \textbf{dynamic typing}, like many scripting languages (such
    as Guile, Python, Lua, etc). Of course the dynamically typed data
    inside the \textit{Bismon monitor} is \index{garbage
      collection}{\textbf{garbage collected}}
    (cf. \cite{Jones:2011:GC-handbook})
    \footnote{The initial GC of
      the monitor is a crude precise garbage collector, but
      multi-thread compatible; it uses a naive stop-the-world
      mark\&sweep algorithm. Improving that GC is a difficult work
      (past experience on \emph{GCC MELT} taught us that developing
      and debugging a GC is hard). We might consider later using MPS
      from \bmurl{https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/} but doing
      that could require recoding or regenerating a lot of code.}

  \item \textbf{homoiconicity} and \textbf{reflection} with
    \textbf{introspection}: all the DSL code is explicitly represented
    as data which can be processed by \textit{Bismon}, and the current
    state is accessible by the DSL.

    \item \textbf{translated} to \emph{C} code; and \textbf{generated}
      \emph{JavaScript} + \emph{HTML} in the browser, and generated
      \emph{C++} code of \emph{GCC} plugins

    \item \textbf{bootstrapped implementation}: ideally, all of
      \textit{Bismon} code (including C code dealing with data
      representations, persistent store, etc...) should be
      generated. However, this ideal has not yet be attained, and
      there is still some hand-written C code. It is hoped that most
      of the hand-written C code will become replaced by generated C
      code.
    \item ability to \textbf{generate GCC plugins}: the C++ code of
      GCC plugins performing static analysis of a single translation
      unit should be generated.

    \item with \textbf{collaborative web interface}, used by a
      \emph{small} team of \emph{trusted and well-behaving}
      developers\footnote{The initial \texttt{bismon} implementation
        had a GTK interface, nearly unusable. That interface is
        temporarily used to fill the persistent store till the web
        interface is usable. The GTK interface is already obsolete and
        should disappear at end of 2018}. The users of \emph{bismon}
      are expected to trust each other, and to use the \texttt{bismon}
      tool responsibly\footnote{For example, each \emph{bismon} user
        has the technical ability to erase most of the data inside
        \textit{Bismon monitor}, but is expected to not do so}
      (likewise, developers accessing a \texttt{git} version control
      repository are supposed to act responsibly even if they are
      technically capable of removing most of the source code and its
      history stored in that repository). So protection
      against malicious behavior of \texttt{bismon} users is out of
      scope.

      Since \textit{Bismon} should be usable by a small team of
      developers (perhaps two or a dozen of them)\footnote{So
        \textit{Bismon}, considered as a Web application, would have
        at most a dozen of browsers -and associated users- accessing
        it. Hence, scalability to many HTTP connections is not at all
        a concern (in contrast with most usual web applications).}, it
      is handling some \index{personal data}{personal data} (relevant
      to \index{GDPR}{GDPR}), such as the first and last names (or
      pseudos) of users and their email and maintain a password file
      (used in the Web \index{login}{login} form). Compliance to
      regulations (e.g. European GDPR) is out of scope and should be
      in charge of the entities and/or persons using and/or deploying
      \textit{Bismon}. The login form template \footnote{on
        \bmurl{https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/blob/master/login\_ONIONBM.thtml}}
      could be adapted on each deployment site.
\end{itemize}

Notice that \textit{Bismon} is \textbf{provided as free software}
(unreleased in 2018, but available on
\bmurl{github.com/bstarynk/bismon} ...) in \emph{source form only} and
should be \textbf{usable} (only) \textbf{on a Linux/x86-64
  workstation}... (typically, at least 32 gigabytes of RAM and
preferably more, at least 8 cores, several hundreds gigabytes of disk
or SSD).

The \textit{Bismon} system contains \textbf{persistent data} (which is
part of the system itself and should not be considered as ``external''
data; each team using \textit{Bismon} would run its own customized
version of it.), and should be \textbf{regularily backed up}, and
preferably version controlled at the user site. It is strongly
recommended to use \index{git}{\texttt{git}} \footnote{See
  \bmurl{http://git-scm.com/}} or perhaps some other distributed
\index{version control}{version control} system, to \texttt{git
  commit} its files several times a day (probably hourly or even more
frequently, as often as a developer is committing his C++ code), and
to backup the files on some external media or server at least
daily. How that is done is outside of the scope of this document. The
\emph{dump facilities} inside \textit{Bismon} are expected to be used
quite often (as often as you would save your report in a word
processor, or your source file in a source code editor), probably
several times per hour. So a developer team using \textit{Bismon}
would probably \texttt{git clone} either
\texttt{git@github.com:bstarynk/bismon.git} thru SSH or
\bmurl{https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon.git}, build it (after
downloading and building required dependencies), and work on that
\texttt{git} repository (and of course back-up it quite often).

\subsection{Multi-threaded and distributed aspects of \textit{Bismon}}

The \textit{Bismon monitor} is by itself a multi-threaded
process\footnote{In contrast of most scripting languages
  implementations such as Python, Ocaml, Ruby, etc..., we try hard to
  avoid any ``global interpreter lock'' and strive to develop a
  genuinely multi-threaded monitor.}.  It uses a \emph{fixed thread
  pool} of worker threads (often active)
\footnote{The number of worker threads is given by the \texttt{--job}
  program argument to \texttt{bismon}. For an 8-cores workstation, it
  is suggested to set it to 5 or 6. It should be at least 2, and at
  most 15. This number also limits the set of simultaneously running
  external processes.}, and additional (generally idle) threads for
web support and other facilities. The \textit{Bismon monitor} is
occasionally starting some external processes (e.g. for the
compilation of \emph{C} code dynamically generated by \textit{Bismon},
before \texttt{dlopen}-ing such modules).

% In practice the Bismon
% monitor is likely to be started every working day and would run the
% whole day (in particular because the set of \texttt{dlopen}-ed modules
% is continuously growing and never shrinking; in other words, code
% generated by \text{Bismon} for its internal purposes is \emph{never}
%   \index{garbage collection}{garbage collected}).
