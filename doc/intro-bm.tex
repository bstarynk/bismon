\subsection{About \textit{Bismon}}

\textit{Bismon}\footnote{\texttt{bismon} is a \textbf{temporary name}
  and could be changed, once we find a better name for it} is a free
software static source code whole-program analysis framework (whose
initial domain will be \emph{Internet of Things} (or
\index{IoT}{IoT})\footnote{IoT is viewed as the first application
  domain of \textit{Bismon}, but it is hoped that most of
  \textit{Bismon} could be reused and later extended for other
  domains}. It is designed to work with the \textit{Gcc} compiler (see
\bmurl{gcc.gnu.org}) on a Linux workstation. \textit{Bismon} is the
successor of \textit{GCC MELT} \footnote{The \textit{GCC MELT} web
  pages used to be on \texttt{gcc-melt.org} -a DNS domain relinquished
  in april 2018- and are archived on
  \bmurl{starynkevitch.net/Basile/gcc-melt}} \cite{Starynkevitch2007Multistage, starynkevitch-DSL2011}.

\textit{Bismon} is \textbf{work in progress}, and many things
described here are not fully implemented in 2018.
