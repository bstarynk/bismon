\section{Static analysis of source code in \emph{Bismon}}
\label{sec:staticanalys}

{\Large @@ To be written.}

A significant part of this chapter should be generated (like \emph{GCC
  MELT} generated its documentation) from the persistent state of
\emph{Bismon}. Perhaps this chapter should be put after the ``using
Bismon'' chapter (ยง\ref{sec:using}).

\subsection{static analysis of \emph{GCC}}

The \emph{GCC} compiler has a complex (and ill-defined,
under-documented and evolving, so unstable) API which can be used by
plugins. So \emph{Bismon} needs to analyze the various \emph{GCC}
plugin related headers to extract important information about that
API, so to be later able to generate \emph{GCC} plugin code.

We probably would take as an example the analysis of
