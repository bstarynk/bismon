\section{Using \emph{Bismon}}
\label{sec:using}

{\Large @@ To be written.} Most of that should be generated from data persisted inside \emph{bismon}. Perhaps
should be exchanged with the ``static analysis'' chapter
(ยง\ref{sec:staticanalys}).

%\bigskip

%Notice that most of \emph{GCC MELT} documentation was generated. See its
%{\small\bmurl{http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/gcc-melt/meltpluginapi.html/meltpluginapi.html}}. Likewise,
%most of this chapter will be machine generated from the persistent
%state of \emph{Bismon}
